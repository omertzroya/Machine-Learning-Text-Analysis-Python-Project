## 📚 Description

This project coming to create a machine learning flow that represented all the step
from pre-proccesing to the cross validation split, using piplines for machine learning models.
The project's goal is to evaluate the f1 macro score that we get in the cross val step , take those great models we've found and with them predict wheater text from the given courpus has written by a female or 
a male.
For sum up, save the result into a CSV file.

## 🚀 Features

- Text classification using multiple machine learning algorithms.
- Data preprocessing including text vectorization and normalization.
- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search.
- ROC curve visualization for model evaluation.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gender-prediction.git
